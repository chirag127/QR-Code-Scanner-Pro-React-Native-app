    *   In-app browser (URLs will open in the default OS browser).
    *   Advertisements or monetization features.
    *   Tablet-specific layouts (focus is on phone UI).
    *   Web or Desktop versions.

**4. User Personas & Scenarios**

*   **4.1. Primary Persona(s)**
    *   **Alex the Everyday User:** Alex encounters QR codes occasionally (on posters, product packaging, restaurant menus). They need a simple, fast app that opens quickly, scans reliably, and lets them easily open links, copy text, or connect to Wi-Fi without fuss or ads. They might occasionally look back at something they scanned recently.

*   **4.2. Key User Scenarios / Use Cases**
    *   **Scanning a URL:** Alex opens QuickScan Pro, points it at a poster with a URL QR code. The app instantly detects the code, displays the URL, and shows buttons "Open URL" and "Copy". Alex taps "Open URL" and is taken to their default web browser.
    *   **Connecting to Wi-Fi:** Alex is at a friend's house and scans a QR code for their Wi-Fi. The app detects it, displays the network name (SSID), and shows buttons "Connect to Wi-Fi" and "Copy Password". Alex taps "Connect to Wi-Fi", and the OS prompts them to join the network (or handles it directly if possible).
    *   **Saving a Contact:** Alex scans a business card with a vCard QR code. The app detects it, displays the contact name/details, and shows buttons "Add Contact" and "Copy Details". Alex taps "Add Contact", grants Contacts permission when prompted, and the OS contact saving interface appears pre-filled.
    *   **Reviewing Past Scan:** Alex remembers scanning a product link a few days ago. They open QuickScan Pro, navigate to the "History" tab, scroll or search for the product name/URL, find the entry, and tap it to see the details and action buttons again.

**5. User Stories**

*   **US1:** As Alex, I want to open the app and have the camera immediately ready to scan, so I can capture QR codes quickly.
*   **US2:** As Alex, I want the app to automatically detect the type of content in the QR code (like URL, Wi-Fi, Contact), so I know what kind of information it is.
*   **US3:** As Alex, I want to see clear buttons for relevant actions after scanning (like "Open URL" or "Add Contact"), so I can easily perform the next step.
*   **US4:** As Alex, I want a simple way to copy the raw text content of any scanned QR code, so I can paste it elsewhere.
*   **US5:** As Alex, I want the app to save a history of my scans locally on my device, so I can refer back to them later without needing an account.
*   **US6:** As Alex, I want to search my scan history, so I can quickly find a specific item I scanned previously.
*   **US7:** As Alex, I want the app to clearly ask for Camera permission and explain why it's needed, so I feel comfortable granting it.
*   **US8:** As Alex, I want the app to only ask for Contacts permission *when* I try to save a contact, respecting my privacy.

**8. UI/UX Requirements & Design**

*   **8.1. Wireframes / Mockups**
    *   (Conceptual) A primary tab/screen shows the full camera view with minimal UI overlay (maybe a subtle viewfinder). A secondary tab shows the list-based History view. A modal/popup appears post-scan showing content and action buttons. Styling via `NativeWind`.

*   **8.2. Key UI Elements**
    *   Scanner View: Full-screen camera (`react-native-vision-camera`).
    *   Scan Results Display: Modal or dedicated screen showing detected content type (icon), preview/full content, and context-specific action buttons.
    *   History List: Scrollable list (`FlatList`) showing entries with icon, content snippet, date. Search bar included.
    *   Navigation: Simple bottom tab navigation likely (`Expo Router` configured for tabs).

*   **8.3. User Flow Diagrams**
    *   (Conceptual)
        *   App Launch -> Camera View -> Scan -> Results View -> Action (e.g., Open URL) -> Back to Camera View.
        *   App Launch -> History Tab -> Scroll/Search -> Select Item -> Results View -> Action.
